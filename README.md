> A professional architectural implementation of the **Repository Pattern** and **Unit of Work Pattern** in .NET, designed for scalability, maintainability, and testability.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project provides a clean and scalable architecture using two of the most widely adopted design patterns in enterprise application development:  
- **Repository Pattern**
- **Unit of Work Pattern**

These patterns are used to decouple business logic from data access logic, enabling better code organization, easier testing, and long-term maintainability.

---

## 🧱 Architectural Design

The solution is structured into clear and modular components:

- **Repositories**: Encapsulate all data access logic.
- **Unit of Work**: Coordinates multiple repositories within a single transactional context.
- **Domain Models**: Represent the core entities of the system.
- **Data Context**: Manages the database connection and entity mappings.

---

## 🔧 Design Patterns Implemented

### 1. Repository Pattern

Used to abstract and encapsulate all data-related operations. It acts as an intermediary between the domain model and the data layer.

**Why it's important:**
- Centralizes data logic.
- Enables loose coupling.
- Facilitates unit testing through abstraction.

### 2. Unit of Work Pattern

Manages transactions across multiple repositories, ensuring that all operations either succeed or fail together.

**Why it's important:**
- Ensures atomicity of operations.
- Improves performance by batching changes.
- Maintains consistency across data operations.

## ✅ Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Testability** | Business logic can be tested independently using mocks. |
| **Maintainability** | Changes in data access logic do not affect business rules. |
| **Scalability** | New features and entities can be added with minimal impact on existing code. |
| **Consistency** | Transactions ensure reliable data integrity across multiple operations. |

---

## 🚀 Why This Architecture?

By implementing these patterns, the solution adheres to modern software development principles such as:
- **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

This makes the codebase more adaptable to future changes and easier to extend without introducing side effects.
